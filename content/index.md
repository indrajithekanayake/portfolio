I'm an independent researcher, worked in academia for 5 years, and am currently working at <a href="https://codification.io/" target="_blank">codification.io</a>, a cloud-native consulting firm based in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. I'm also a recipient of the <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/MVP/profile/a25fdb68-34b6-4106-a247-09ac2caffed4" target="_blank">Most Valuable Professional(MVP) Award</a> from Microsoft.

I have three primary goals* in my life;

1. Being the best educator I can be
2. Designing interactions in immersive learning environments
3. Working forefront, brain-computer interface, and the next generation of artificial intelligence.
