Mentored two student community leaders through IEEE VoLT organized by [IEEE Member and Geographic Activities](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ieee-member-and-geographic-activities/) 
  
If someone wants to take part in IEEE leadership I highly recommend the VoLT program and I will be a mentor coming years too.  
  
Thank you professor [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACw2Ci4BskAdnCv2-7hljG-3T5S731xNFNo)[Mousmi Ajay Chaurasia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mousmi-ajay-chaurasia-17a4a7188/) for sending this cool sleeping blanket
